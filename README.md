This project develops a CNN model to classify images of plastic waste into categories like bottles, bags, and containers. It involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to improve recycling efficiency. The goal is to create an AI-powered system for automated waste sorting, promoting sustainability and better waste management.
